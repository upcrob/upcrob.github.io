Welcome to my personal site.  It contains odds and ends that are of interest to me.  Sometimes I even update it, too.

## Bio

Rob is a software developer based in the Twin Cities area.  When he's not programming or thinking in big _O_ notation, he's sailing, playing racquetball, and generally spending time in the great outdoors away from glowing computer screens.  Sometimes he writes about himself in the third-person.
